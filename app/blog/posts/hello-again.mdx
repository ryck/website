### Hello! (Again)

I started blogging a long time ago (June 2004 to be precise, I am old!), but I stopped in 2012 because, well, life got complicated:

- I worked for NBC, BBC, PWC, Bookatable... I was prety busy! 👨🏻‍💻
- I got engaged 💍
- I got married 💒
- I moved from Drupal to React / React Native ⚛️
- I bought <s>a house</s> two houses 🏠🏠
- I bought <s>a car</s> two cars 🚗🚗
- I moved to fintech 💰
- I had <s>a son</s> two sons! 👶🏻👶🏻

As you can imagine, most of those things required some kind of attention (especially the last one!) but now seems like a good time to start again, and I really missed having my own place to write some stuff now and then!

Another reason to start again is to use the tools I use at work for my personal site. My previous blog was on WordPress + PHP + JQuery an all that (remember, it was a long time ago) so I wanted to use something more modern (in this case, Next,js) to do my blog. That way I can play with things here as well, not just at work.

Last, but not least, I wanted to start wrting more in English. After +10 years in the UK my English is so much better, but I want to get better at 'not-work' English, and writing your blog in English seems like the perfect way to do that (although I'll write a lot of technical stuff too, I guess)

So yeah, I'm back baby!

PS: I used [Lee Robinson's fantastic codebase](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) as the fundation for all this. Please check his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZMli3czZnd1uoc1ShTouQw) as well! Thanks Lee!
